# A-new-keyboard-level-via-capslock
I created a new keyboard level accessible through Capslock to type Enter, Backslash and some programming symbols without moving the right hand away from the home row.
To do understand which caracters to change I just typed xmodmap -pke into the terminal.

Save the file with the name .Xmodmap in the home directory or run the comand xmodmap no_caps.xmodmap in the terminal.

For the future I would like to add a further level accessible though Tab to obtain vim navigation key-bindings.
Also using X keyboard extension might be more convenient.
